# Cookbook

- Well-defined recipes as lists of instructions
  - Instructions are done either on an ingredient or a set of incredients.
  - Ingredients are tags
  - Instructions are tags
  - Measurements are tagged with units
  - An instruction can include sub-actions
    - i.e. "do florp" can be: first do "flop" and then do "lorp"
    - In this case both "flop" and "lorp" need to be defined actions on the set of incredients
- Recipes are searchable by tags
  - "What can I cook with the things I have at home?"
  - "What can I cook with the things I like?"
  - "What can I cook with things, whose name starts with a Q?"
  - "I have `X` at home, what can I cook?"
- Recipes can also be automatically tagged
  - "Contains only vegan ingredients"
  - "Takes N minutes to make", with that time based on the number of instructions and their tagged time.

... many more things that I can't be bothered to write down right now :)
